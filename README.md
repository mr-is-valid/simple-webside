the front(client) is pure css and java script and html , the back(server) is pure asp and the database is on microsoft access.

you need to make a folder that call wwwroot inside of it create a folder that call asp , img .

put the img1,2,3 inside the img folder.

put the asp.rar file inside the asp folder.

inside the asp folder make img folder and copy img1,2,3 into it.

now run it from HomePage.html by using a localhost program.

sorry for making it to complicated its because the images is too big i have to split it.
